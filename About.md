Hello! My name is Eric Chai, and I am currently a student at the University of Illinois, studying Physics with a minor in Computer Science. Although I was introduced into the coding world in the middle of my college career, I have a passion to learn as much as I can, outside of just coursework provided by the school. 

My passion for technology as many others, started at a young age and has grown ever since. After taking an intro level CS Course, I realized that I want to be able to create things from scratch, to turn an idea into something tangible. 

Recently, I have been able to intern at [PSAV](http://company.psav.com/en/home/), one of the leading companies in the Audio/Visual consulting business. Working in a real business setting is truly unique experience that I am thankful I got to be a part of.
